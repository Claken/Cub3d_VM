# CUB3D
This project's goal is to create a 3D graphical reprensentation of the inside of a maze in a 2D game.<br />
This is one of the projects of the 42 common core.

## Prerequisites

I have done this project on a Linux VM, so if you want to have the best conditions to use this program, I suggest to use it in a Linux environment.

## How to launch a game

To use the program, first of all, you need to compile it with the following command:
```bash
  make
```
Then, you will have an executable named `cub3D`.<br />
Now, you need to select a map that you want to explore in the `cub3d_maps` folder:

Once you have chosen a map, type the following command to start a game:
```bash
./cub3D cub3d_maps/the_map_you_have_chosen.cub
```
